<p>TclX - Extended Tcl: Extended command set for Tcl</p>

<h2><a name='sect1' href='TclX.n.html#toc1'><b>Synopsis</b></a></h2>

<p><b>package</b> <b>require</b> <b>Tclx</b></p>

<h2><a name='sect2' href='TclX.n.html#toc2'><b>Introduction</b></a></h2>

<p>This man page contains the documentation for all of the
extensions that are added to Tcl by Extended Tcl (TclX). TclX
extends Tcl&acirc;&euro;&trade;s capabili-ties by adding new
commands to it, without changing the syntax of stan-dard Tcl.
Extended Tcl is a superset of standard Tcl and is built alongside
the standard Tcl sources.</p>

<p>Extended Tcl was created by Karl Lehenbauer and Mark Diekhans
and is freely redistributable for any use without license or
fee.</p>

<p>Available since 1989, Extended Tcl, also known as TclX, not only
adds capabilities to Tcl, but has also been the source of many of
the capa-bilities of the baseline Tcl release, including arrays,
files, sockets, file events, and date and time handling, among
others.</p>

<p>Extended Tcl introduces a set of new commands and a
user-extensible library of useful Tcl procedures, any of which can
be automatically loaded on the first attempt to execute it.</p>

<p>The command descriptions are separated into several
sections:</p>

<p>&Acirc;&middot; General Commands</p>

<p>&Acirc;&middot; Debugging and Development Commands</p>

<p>&Acirc;&middot; Unix Access Commands</p>

<p>&Acirc;&middot; File Commands</p>

<p>&Acirc;&middot; Network Programming Support</p>

<p>&Acirc;&middot; File Scanning Commands</p>

<p>&Acirc;&middot; Math Commands</p>

<p>&Acirc;&middot; List Manipulation Commands</p>

<p>&Acirc;&middot; Keyed Lists</p>

<p>&Acirc;&middot; String and Character Manipulation Commands</p>

<p>&Acirc;&middot; XPG/3 Message Catalog Commands</p>

<p>&Acirc;&middot; Help Facility</p>

<p>&Acirc;&middot; Tcl Loadable Libraries and Packages</p>

<h2><a name='sect3' href='TclX.n.html#toc3'><b>General</b>
<b>Commands</b></a></h2>

<p>A set of general, useful Tcl commands, includes a command to
begin an interactive session with Tcl, a facility for tracing
execution, and a looping command.</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>dirs</b></dt>

<dd>This procedure lists the directories in the directory
stack.</dd>
</dl>

<p><b>commandloop</b> ?<b>-async</b>? ?<b>-interactive</b>
<b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>|</b> <b>tty</b>? ?<b>-prompt1</b>
<i>cmd</i>? ?<b>-prompt2</b> <i>cmd</i>? ?<b>-endcommand</b>
<i>cmd</i>?</p>

<p>Create an interactive command loop reading commands from stdin
and writing results to stdout. Command loops are maybe either be
blocking or event oriented. This command is useful for Tcl scripts
that do not normally converse interactively with a user through a
Tcl command interpreter, but which sometimes want to enter this
mode, perhaps for debugging or user configuration. The command loop
terminates on EOF.</p>

<p>The following options are available:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>-async</b> A</dt>

<dd>command handler will be associated with stdin. When input is
available on stdin, it will be read and accumu-lated until a full
command is available. That command will then be evaluated. An event
loop must be entered for input to be read and processed.</dd>

<dt><b>-interactive</b> <b>on</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b> <b>|</b>
<b>tty</b></dt>

<dd>Enable or disable interactive command mode. In interac-tive
mode, commands are prompted for and the results of comments are
printed. The value maybe any boolean value or <b>tty</b>. If
<b>tty</b> is used, interactive mode is enabled if stdin is
associated with a terminal or terminal emulator. The default is
<b>tty</b>.</dd>

<dt><b>-prompt1</b> <i>cmd</i></dt>

<dd>If specified, <i>cmd</i> is used is evaluate and its result
used for the main command prompt. If not specified, the command in
<b>tcl_prompt1</b> is evaluated to output the prompt. Note the
difference in behavior, <i>cmd</i> results is used, while
<b>tcl_prompt1</b> outputs. This is to allow for future expansion
to command loops that write to other than std-out.</dd>

<dt><b>-prompt2</b> <i>cmd</i></dt>

<dd>If specified, <i>cmd</i> is used is evaluate and its result
used for the secondary (continuation) command prompt. If not
specified, the command in <b>tcl_prompt2</b> is evaluated to output
the prompt.</dd>

<dt><b>-endcommand</b> <i>cmd</i></dt>

<dd>If specified, <i>cmd</i> is evaluated when the command loop
ter-minates.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In interactive mode, the results of set commands with two
arguments are not printed.</p>

<p>If <b>SIGINT</b> is configured to generate a Tcl error, it can
be used to delete the current command being type without aborting
the program in progress.</p>

<p><b>echo</b> ?<i>str</i> <i>...</i>?<br>
 Writes zero or more strings to standard output, followed by a
newline.</p>

<p><b>infox</b> <i>option</i></p>

<p>Return information about Extended Tcl, or the current
applica-tion. The following <b>infox</b> command options are
available:</p>

<p><b>version</b><br>
 Return the version number of Extended Tcl. The version number for
Extended Tcl is generated by combining the base version of the
standard Tcl code with another number indicating the version of
Extended Tcl being used.</p>

<p><b>patchlevel</b><br>
 Return the patchlevel for Extended Tcl.</p>

<p><b>have_fchown</b><br>
 Return <b>1</b> if the <b>fchown</b> system call is available.
This supports the <b>-fileid</b> option on the <b>chown</b> and
<b>chgrp</b> com-mands.</p>

<p><b>have_fchmod</b><br>
 Return <b>1</b> if the <b>fchmod</b> system call is available.
This supports the <b>-fileid</b> option on the <b>chmod</b>
command.</p>

<p><b>have_flock</b><br>
 Return <b>1</b> if the <b>flock</b> command defined, <b>0</b> if
it is not available.</p>

<p><b>have_fsync</b><br>
 Return <b>1</b> if the <b>fsync</b> system call is available and
the <b>sync</b> command will sync individual files. <b>0</b> if it
is not available and the <b>sync</b> command will always sync all
file buffers.</p>

<p><b>have_ftruncate</b><br>
 Return <b>1</b> if the <b>ftruncate</b> or <b>chsize</b> system
call is avail-able. If it is, the <b>ftruncate</b> command
<b>-fileid</b> option maybe used.</p>

<p><b>have_msgcats</b><br>
 Return <b>1</b> if XPG message catalogs are available, <b>0</b> if
they are not. The <b>catgets</b> is designed to continue to
function without message catalogs, always returning the default
string.</p>

<p><b>have_posix_signals</b><br>
 Return <b>1</b> if Posix signals are available (<b>block</b> and
<b>unblock</b> options available for the signal command). <b>0</b>
is returned if Posix signals are not available.</p>

<p><b>have_signal_restart</b><br>
 Return <b>1</b> if restartable signals are available
(<b>-restart</b> option available for the signal command). <b>0</b>
is returned if restartable signals are not available.</p>

<p><b>have_truncate</b><br>
 Return <b>1</b> if the <b>truncate</b> system call is available.
If it is, the <b>ftruncate</b> command may truncate by file
path.</p>

<p><b>have_waitpid</b><br>
 Return <b>1</b> if the <b>waitpid</b> system call is available and
the <b>wait</b> command has full functionality. <b>0</b> if the
<b>wait</b> com-mand has limited functionality.</p>

<p><b>appname</b><br>
 Return the symbolic application name of the current application
linked with the Extended Tcl library. The C variable
<b>tclAppName</b> must be set by the application to return an
application specific value for this variable.</p>

<p><b>applongname</b><br>
 Return a natural language name for the current applica-tion. The C
variable <b>tclLongAppName</b> must be set by the application to
return an application specific value for this variable.</p>

<p><b>appversion</b><br>
 Return the version number for the current application. The C
variable <b>tclAppVersion</b> must be set by the applica-tion to
return an application-specific value for this variable.</p>

<p><b>apppatchlevel</b><br>
 Return the patchlevel for the current application. The C variable
<b>tclAppPatchlevel</b> must be set by the application to return an
application-specific value for this vari-able.</p>

<p><b>for_array_keys</b> <i>var</i> <i>array</i><b>_</b><i>name</i>
<i>code</i><br>
 This procedure performs a foreach-style loop for each key in the
named array. The <b>break</b> and <b>continue</b> statements work
as with <b>foreach</b>.</p>

<p><b>for_recursive_glob</b> <i>var</i> <i>dirlist</i>
<i>globlist</i> <i>code</i> This procedure performs a foreach-style
loop over recursively matched files. All directories in
<i>dirlist</i> are recursively searched (breadth-first), comparing
each file found against the file glob patterns in <b>globlist</b>.
For each matched file, the variable <i>var</i> is set to the file
path and <i>code</i> is evaluated. Symbolic links are not
followed.</p>

<p><b>loop</b> <i>var</i> <i>first</i> <i>limit</i>
<i>?increment?</i> <i>body</i><br>
 <b>Loop</b> is a looping command, similar in behavior to the Tcl
<b>for</b> statement, except that the <b>loop</b> statement
achieves substantially higher performance and is easier to code
when the beginning and ending values of a loop are known, and the
loop variable is to be incremented by a known, fixed amount every
time through the loop.</p>

<p>The <i>var</i> argument is the name of a Tcl variable that will
con-tain the loop index. The loop index is set to the value
speci-fied by <i>first</i>. The Tcl interpreter is invoked upon
<i>body</i> zero or more times, where <i>var</i> is incremented by
<i>increment</i> every time through the loop, or by one if
<i>increment</i> is not specified. <i>Increment</i> can be negative
in which case the loop will count downwards.</p>

<p>When <i>var</i> reaches <i>limit</i>, the loop terminates
without a subsequent execution of <i>body</i>. For instance, if the
original <b>loop</b> parame-ters would cause <b>loop</b> to
terminate, say <i>first</i> was one, <i>limit</i> was zero and
<i>increment</i> was not specified or was non-negative, <i>body</i>
is not executed at all and <b>loop</b> returns.</p>

<p>The <i>first</i>, <i>limit</i> and <i>increment</i> are integer
expressions. They are only evaluated once at the beginning of the
loop.</p>

<p>If a <b>continue</b> command is invoked within <i>body</i> then
any remaining commands in the current execution of <i>body</i> are
skipped, as in the <b>for</b> command. If a <b>break</b> command is
invoked within <i>body</i> then the <b>loop</b> command will return
immediately. <b>Loop</b> returns an empty string.</p>

<p><b>popd</b> This procedure pops the top directory entry from the
directory stack and make it the current directory.</p>

<p><b>pushd</b> ?<i>dir</i>?<br>
 This procedure pushes the current directory onto the directory
stack and <b>cd</b> to the specified directory. If the directory is
not specified, then the current directory is pushed, but remains
unchanged.</p>

<p><b>recursive_glob</b> <i>dirlist</i> <i>globlist</i><br>
 This procedure returns a list of recursively matches files. All
directories in <i>dirlist</i> are recursively searched
(breadth-first), comparing each file found against the file glob
patterns in <b>globlist</b>. Symbolic links are not followed.</p>

<p><b>showproc</b> ?<i>procname</i> <i>...?</i><br>
 This procedure lists the definition of the named procedures.
Loading them if it is not already loaded. If no procedure names are
supplied, the definitions of all currently loaded procedures are
returned.</p>

<p><b>try_eval</b> <i>code</i> <i>catch</i> ?<i>finally</i>?<br>
 The <b>try_eval</b> command evaluates <i>code</i> in the current
context.</p>

<p>If an error occurs during the evaluation and <i>catch</i> is not
empty, then <i>catch</i> is evaluated to handler the error. The
result of the command, containing the error message, will be stored
in a global variable <b>errorResult</b>. The global variables
<b>errorResult</b>, <b>errorInfo</b> and <b>errorCode</b> will be
imported into the current scope, there is no need to execute a
<b>global</b> command. The result of the <i>catch</i> command
becomes the result of the <b>try_eval</b> command. If the error
that caused the <i>catch</i> to be evalu-ate is to be continued,
the following command should be used: <b>error</b>
<b>$errorResult</b> <b>$errorCode</b> <b>$errorInfo</b></p>

<p>If the <i>finally</i> argument is supplied and not empty, it is
evaluated after the evaluation of the <i>code</i> and the
<i>catch</i> commands. If an error occurs during the evaluation of
the <i>finally</i> command, it becomes the result of the
<b>try_eval</b> command. Otherwise, the result of either
<i>code</i> or <i>catch</i> is preserved, as described above.</p>

<h2><a name='sect4' href='TclX.n.html#toc4'><b>Debugging</b> <b>and</b>
<b>Development</b> <b>Commands</b></a></h2>

<p>This section contains information on commands and procedures
that are useful for developing and debugging Tcl scripts.</p>

<p><b>cmdtrace</b> <i>level</i> | <b>on</b> ?<b>noeval</b>?
?<b>notruncate</b>? ?<i>procs</i>? ?<i>fileid</i>? ?<b>command</b>
<i>cmd</i>?</p>

<p>Print a trace statement for all commands executed at depth of
<i>level</i> or below (1 is the top level). If <b>on</b> is
specified, all commands at any level are traced. The following
options are available:</p>

<p><b>noeval</b> Causes arguments to be printed unevaluated. If
<b>noeval</b> is specified, the arguments are printed before
evaluation. Otherwise, they are printed afterwards.</p>

<p>If the command line is longer than 60 characters, it is
truncated to 60 and a ... is postpended to indicate that there was
more output than was displayed. If an evaluated argument contains a
space, the entire argument will be enclosed inside of braces
(&acirc;&euro;&tilde;{}&acirc;&euro;&trade;) to allow the reader to
visually separate the arguments from each other.</p>

<p><b>notruncate</b><br>
 Disables the truncation of commands and evaluated argu-ments.</p>

<p><b>procs</b> Enables the tracing of procedure calls only.
Commands that aren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t procedure calls (i.e. calls
to commands that are written in C, C++ or some object-compatible
language) are not traced if the <b>procs</b> option is specified.
This option is particularly useful for greatly reducing the output
of <b>cmdtrace</b> while debugging.</p>

<p><b>fileid</b> This is a file id as returned by the <b>open</b>
command. If specified, then the trace output will be written to the
file rather than stdout. A stdio buffer flush is done after every
line is written so that the trace may be mon-itored externally or
provide useful information for debugging problems that cause core
dumps.</p>

<p><b>command</b> <i>cmd</i></p>

<p>Call the specified command <i>cmd</i> on when each command is
executed instead of tracing to a file. See the descrip-tion of the
functionally below. This option may not be specified with a
<b>fileid</b>.</p>

<p>The most common use of this command is to enable tracing to a
file during the development. If a failure occurs, a trace is then
available when needed. Command tracing will slow down the execution
of code, so it should be removed when code is debugged. The
following command will enable tracing to a file for the remainder
of the program:</p>

<p>cmdtrace on [open cmd.log w]</p>

<p>The <b>command</b> option causes a user specified trace command
to be called for each command executed. The command will have the
following arguments appended to it before evaluation:</p>

<p><i>command</i><br>
 A string containing the text of the command, before any argument
substitution.</p>

<p><i>argv</i> A list of the final argument information that will
be passed to the command after command, variable, and backslash
substitution.</p>

<p><i>evalLevel</i><br>
 The <b>Tcl_Eval</b> call level.</p>

<p><i>procLevel</i><br>
 The procedure call level.</p>

<p>The command should be constructed in such a manner that it will
work if additional arguments are added in the future. It is
suggested that the command be a <b>proc</b> with the final argument
being <b>args</b>.</p>

<p>Tracing will be turned off while the command is being executed.
The values of the <b>errorInfo</b> and <b>errorCode</b> variables
will be saved and restored on return from the command. It is the
com-mand&acirc;&euro;&trade;s responsibility to preserve all other
state.</p>

<p>If an error occurs during the execution of <b>command</b>, an
error message is dumped to stderr and the tracing is disabled. The
underlying mechanism that this functionality is built on does not
support returning an error to the interpreter.</p>

<p><b>cmdtrace</b> <b>off</b><br>
 Turn off all tracing.</p>

<p><b>cmdtrace</b> <b>depth</b><br>
 Returns the current maximum trace level, or zero if trace is
disabled.</p>

<p><b>edprocs</b> ?<i>proc</i>...?<br>
 This procedure writes the named procedures, or all currently
defined procedures, to a temporary file, then calls an editor on it
(as specified by the <b>EDITOR</b> environment variable, or
<b>vi</b> if none is specified), then sources the file back in if
it was changed.</p>

<p><b>profile</b> ?<i>-commands</i>? ?<i>-eval</i>? <b>on</b></p>

<p><b>profile</b> <b>off</b> <i>arrayVar</i><br>
 This command is used to collect a performance profile of a Tcl
script. It collects data at the Tcl procedure level. The number of
calls to a procedure, and the amount of real and CPU time is
collected. Time is also collected for the global context. The
procedure data is collected by bucketing it based on the proce-dure
call stack, this allows determination of how much time is spent in
a particular procedure in each of it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s calling
con-texts.</p>

<p>The <b>on</b> option enables profile data collection. If the
<b>-commands</b> option is specified, data on all commands within a
procedure is collected as well a procedures. Multiple occurrences
of a com-mand within a procedure are not distinguished, but this
data may still be useful for analysis.</p>

<p>The <b>off</b> option turns off profiling and moves the data
collected to the array <i>arrayVar</i>. The array is address by a
list contain-ing the procedure call stack. Element zero is the top
of the stack, the procedure that the data is for. The data in each
entry is a list consisting of the procedure call count and the real
time and CPU time in milliseconds spent in the procedure (but not
any procedures it calls). The list is in the form {<i>count</i>
<i>real</i> <i>cpu</i>}.</p>

<p>Normally, the variable scope stack is used in reporting where
time is spent. Thus upleveled code is reported in the context that
it was executed in, not the context that the uplevel was called in.
If the <b>-eval</b> option is specified, the procedure evaluation
(call) stack is used instead of the procedure scope stack.
Upleveled code is reported in the context of the procedure that did
the uplevel.</p>

<p>A Tcl procedure <b>profrep</b> is supplied for reducing the data
and producing a report.</p>

<p>On <b>Windows</b>, profile command only reports elapsed real
time, CPU time is not available and is reported as zero.</p>

<p><b>profrep</b> <i>profDataVar</i> <i>sortKey</i>
?<i>outFile</i>? ?<i>userTitle</i>? This procedure generates a
report from data collect from the profile command.
<b>ProfDataVar</b> is the name of the array contain-ing the data
returned by the <b>profile</b> command. <b>SortKey</b> indicates
which data value to sort by. It should be one of <b>calls</b>",
<b>cpu</b>" or <b>real</b>". <b>OutFile</b> is the name of file to
write the report to. If omitted, stdout is assumed.
<b>UserTitle</b> is an optional title line to add to output.</p>

<p>Listed with indentation below each procedure or command is the
procedure call stack. The first indented line being the proce-dure
that invoked the reported procedure or command. The next line is
the procedure that invoked the procedure above it, and so on. If no
indented procedures are shown, the procedure or command was called
from the global context. Time actually spent in the global context
is listed on a line labeled <b>&lt;global&gt;</b>. Upleveled code
is reported in the context that it was executed in, not the context
that the uplevel was called in.</p>

<p><b>saveprocs</b> <i>fileName</i> ?<i>proc</i>...?<br>
 This procedure saves the definition of the named procedure, or all
currently defined procedures if none is specified, to the named
file.</p>

<h2><a name='sect5' href='TclX.n.html#toc5'><b>UNIX</b> <b>Access</b>
<b>Commands</b></a></h2>

<p>These commands provide access to many basic Unix facilities,
including process handling, date and time processing, signal
handling and the executing commands via the shell.</p>

<p><b>alarm</b> <i>seconds</i><br>
 Instructs the system to send a SIGALRM signal in the specified
number of seconds. This is a floating point number, so frac-tions
of a section may be specified. If <i>seconds</i> is 0.0, any
previous alarm request is canceled. Only one alarm at a time may be
active; the command returns the number of seconds left in the
previous alarm. On systems without the <b>setitimer</b> system
call, <i>seconds</i> is rounded up to an integer number of
seconds.</p>

<p>The <b>alarm</b> command is not available on <b>Windows</b>.</p>

<p><b>execl</b> ?<b>-argv0</b> argv0? <i>prog</i>
?<i>arglist</i>?<br>
 Do an execl, replacing the current program (either Extended Tcl or
an application with Extended Tcl embedded into it) with <i>prog</i>
and passing the arguments in the list <i>arglist</i>.</p>

<p>The <b>-argv0</b> options specifies that <i>argv0</i> is to be
passed to the program as argv [0] rather than <i>prog</i>.</p>

<p>Note: If you are using <b>execl</b> in a Tk application and it
fails, you may not do anything that accesses the X server or you
will receive a <b>BadWindow</b> error from the X server. This
includes exe-cuting the Tk version of the <b>exit</b> command. We
suggest using the following command to abort Tk applications after
an <b>execl</b> fail-ure:</p>

<p>kill [id process]</p>

<p>On <b>Windows</b>, where the <b>fork</b> command is not
available, <b>execl</b> starts a new process and returns the
process id.</p>

<p><b>chroot</b> <i>dirname</i><br>
 Change root directory to <i>dirname</i>, by invoking the POSIX <a
href='http://localhost/activetcl/8.6/tcl/tclx/chroot.2.html'>chroot(2)</a> system call. This command only
succeeds if running as root.</p>

<p><b>fork</b> Fork the current Tcl process. Fork returns zero to
the child process and the process number of the child to the parent
pro-cess. If the fork fails, a Tcl error is generated.</p>

<p>If an <b>execl</b> is not going to be performed before the child
pro-cess does output, or if a <b>close</b> and <b>dup</b> sequence
is going to be performed on <b>stdout</b> or <b>stderr</b>, then a
<b>flush</b> should be issued against <b>stdout</b>, <b>stderr</b>
and any other open output file before doing the <b>fork</b>.
Otherwise characters from the parent process pending in the buffers
will be output by both the parent and child processes.</p>

<p>Note: If you are <b>fork</b>ing in a Tk based application you
must <b>execl</b> before doing any window operations in the child
or you will receive a <b>BadWindow</b> error from the X server.</p>

<p>The <b>fork</b> command is not available on <b>Windows</b>.</p>

<p><b>id</b> <b>options</b></p>

<p>This command provides a means of getting, setting and converting
user, group and process ids. The <b>id</b> command has the
following options:</p>

<p><b>id</b> <b>user</b> ?<i>name</i>?</p>

<p><b>id</b> <b>userid</b> ?<i>uid</i>?<br>
 Set the real and effective user ID to <i>name</i> or <i>uid</i>,
if the name (or uid) is valid and permissions allow it. If the name
(or uid) is not specified, the current name (or uid) is
returned.</p>

<p><b>id</b> <b>convert</b> <b>userid</b> <i>uid</i></p>

<p><b>id</b> <b>convert</b> <b>user</b> <i>name</i><br>
 Convert a user ID number to a user name, or vice versa.</p>

<p><b>id</b> <b>group</b> ?<i>name</i>?</p>

<p><b>id</b> <b>groupid</b> ?<i>gid</i>?<br>
 Set the real and effective group ID to <i>name</i> or <i>gid</i>,
if the name (or gid) is valid and permissions allow it. If the
group name (or gid) is not specified, the current group name (or
gid) is returned.</p>

<p><b>id</b> <b>groups</b></p>

<p><b>id</b> <b>groupids</b><br>
 Return the current group access list of the process. The option
<b>groups</b> returns group names and <b>groupids</b> returns id
numbers.</p>

<p><b>id</b> <b>convert</b> <b>groupid</b> <i>gid</i></p>

<p><b>id</b> <b>convert</b> <b>group</b> <i>name</i><br>
 Convert a group ID number to a group name, or vice versa.</p>

<p><b>id</b> <b>effective</b> <b>user</b></p>

<p><b>id</b> <b>effective</b> <b>userid</b><br>
 Return the effective user name, or effective user ID num-ber,
respectively.</p>

<p><b>id</b> <b>effective</b> <b>group</b></p>

<p><b>id</b> <b>effective</b> <b>groupid</b><br>
 Return the effective group name, or effective group ID number,
respectively.</p>

<p><b>id</b> <b>effective</b> <b>groupids</b><br>
 Return all of the groupids the user is a member of.</p>

<p><b>id</b> <b>host</b><br>
 Return the hostname of the system the program is running on.</p>

<p><b>id</b> <b>process</b><br>
 Return the process ID of the current process.</p>

<p><b>id</b> <b>process</b> <b>parent</b><br>
 Return the process ID of the parent of the current pro-cess.</p>

<p><b>id</b> <b>process</b> <b>group</b><br>
 Return the process group ID of the current process.</p>

<p><b>id</b> <b>process</b> <b>group</b> <b>set</b><br>
 Set the process group ID of the current process to its process
ID.</p>

<p><b>id</b> <b>host</b><br>
 Returns the standard host name of the machine the process is
executing on.</p>

<p>On <b>Windows</b>, only the <b>host</b> and <b>process</b>
options are imple-mented.</p>

<p><b>kill</b> ?<b>-pgroup</b> ?<i>signal</i>? <i>idlist</i></p>

<p>Send a signal to the each process in the list <i>idlist</i>, if
permit-ted. <i>Signal</i>, if present, is the signal number or the
symbolic name of the signal, see the signal system call manual
page. The leading
&acirc;&euro;&tilde;&acirc;&euro;&tilde;SIG&acirc;&euro;&trade;&acirc;&euro;&trade;
is optional when the signal is specified by its symbolic name. The
default for <i>signo</i> is 15, SIGTERM.</p>

<p>If <b>-pgroup</b> is specified, the numbers in <i>idlist</i> are
take as pro-cess group ids and the signal is sent to all of the
process in that process group. A process group id of <b>0</b>
specifies the cur-rent process group.</p>

<p>On <b>Windows</b>, the <b>kill</b> command is capable of
terminating a pro-cess, but not of sending an arbitrary signal.</p>

<p><b>link</b> ?<b>-sym</b>? <i>srcpath</i> <i>destpath</i></p>

<p>Create a directory entry, <i>destpath</i>, linking it to the
existing file, <i>srcpath</i>. If <b>-sym</b> is specified, a
symbolic link, rather than a hard link, is created. (The
<b>-sym</b> option is only avail-able on systems that support
symbolic links.)</p>

<p>The <b>link</b> command is not available on <b>Windows</b>. Use
the Tcl 8.4+ <b>file</b> <b>link</b> command instead.</p>

<p><b>nice</b> ?<i>priorityincr</i>?</p>

<p>Change or return the process priority. If <i>priorityincr</i> is
omit-ted, the current priority is returned. If <i>priorityincr</i>
is posi-tive, it is added to the current <i>priority</i> level, up
to a system defined maximum (normally <b>19</b>),</p>

<p>Negative <i>priorityincr</i> values cumulatively increase the
program&acirc;&euro;&trade;s priority down to a system defined
minimum (normally <b>-19</b>); increasing priority with negative
niceness values will only work for the superuser.</p>

<p>The new priority is returned.</p>

<p>The <b>nice</b> command is not available on <b>Windows</b>.</p>

<p><b>readdir</b> ?<i>-hidden</i>? <i>dirPath</i></p>

<p>Returns a list containing the contents of the directory
<i>dirPath</i>. The directory entries . and .. are not
returned.</p>

<p>On <b>Windows</b>, <b>-hidden</b> maybe specified to include
hidden files in the result. This flag is ignored on Unix
systems.</p>

<p><b>signal</b> ?<i>-restart</i>? <i>action</i> <i>siglist</i>
?<i>command</i>?</p>

<p>Warning: If signals are being used as an event source (a
<b>trap</b> action), rather than generating an error to terminate a
task; one must use the <b>-restart</b> option. This causes a
blocked system call, such as <b>read</b> or <b>waitpid</b> to be
restarted rather than gener-ate an error. Failure to do this may
results in unexpected errors when a signal arrives while in one of
these system calls. When available, the <b>-restart</b> option can
prevent this problem.</p>

<p>If <b>-restart</b> is specified, restart blocking system calls
rather than generating an error. The signal will be handled once
the Tcl command that issued the system call completes. The
<b>-restart</b> options is not available on all operating systems
and its use will generate an error when it is not supported. Use
<b>infox</b> <b>have_signal_restart</b> to check for
availability.</p>

<p>Specify the action to take when a Unix signal is received by
Extended Tcl, or a program that embeds it. <i>Siglist</i> is a list
of either the symbolic or numeric Unix signal (the SIG prefix is
optional). <i>Action</i> is one of the following actions to be
per-formed on receipt of the signal. To specify all modifiable
sig-nals, use &acirc;&euro;&tilde;*&acirc;&euro;&trade; (this will
not include SIGKILL and SIGSTOP, as they can not be modified).</p>

<p><b>default</b><br>
 Perform system default action when signal is received (see
<b>signal</b> system call documentation).</p>

<p><b>ignore</b> Ignore the signal.</p>

<p><b>error</b> Generate a catchable Tcl error. It will be as if
the command that was running returned an error. The error code will
be in the form: <b>POSIX</b> <b>SIG</b> <i>signame</i><br>
 For the death of child signal, <i>signame</i> will always be
SIGCHLD, rather than SIGCLD, to allow writing portable code.</p>

<p><b>trap</b> When the signal occurs, execute <i>command</i> and
continue exe-cution if an error is not returned by <i>command</i>.
The com-mand will be executed in the global context. The command
will be edited before execution, replacing occurrences of %S with
the signal name. Occurrences of %% result in a single %". This
editing occurs just before the trap command is evaluated. If an
error is returned, then fol-low the standard Tcl error mechanism.
Often <i>command</i> will just do an <b>exit</b>.</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>get</b></dt>

<dd>Retrieve the current settings of the specified signals. A keyed
list will be returned were the keys are one of the specified
signals and the values are a list consist-ing of the action
associated with the signal, a <b>0</b> if the signal may be
delivered (not block) and a <b>1</b> if it is blocked and a flag
indicating if restarting of system calls is specified. The actions
maybe one of
&acirc;&euro;&tilde;<b>default</b>&acirc;&euro;&trade;,&acirc;&euro;&tilde;<b>
ignore</b>&acirc;&euro;&trade;,
&acirc;&euro;&tilde;<b>error</b>&acirc;&euro;&trade; or
&acirc;&euro;&tilde;<b>trap</b>&acirc;&euro;&trade;. If the action
is trap, the third element is the command associated with the
action. The action
&acirc;&euro;&tilde;<b>unknown</b>&acirc;&euro;&trade; is returned
if a non-Tcl signal handler has been associated with the
signal.</dd>

<dt><b>set</b></dt>

<dd>Set signals from a keyed list in the format returned by the
<b>get</b>. For this action, <i>siglist</i> is the keyed list of
signal state. Signals with an action of
&acirc;&euro;&tilde;<b>unknown</b>&acirc;&euro;&trade; are not
modified.</dd>
</dl>

<p><b>block</b> Block the specified signals from being received.
(Posix systems only).</p>

<p><b>unblock</b><br>
 Allow the specified signal to be received. Pending sig-nals will
not occur. (Posix systems only).</p>

<p>The signal action will remain enabled after the specified signal
has occurred. The exception to this is <b>SIGCHLD</b> on systems
with-out Posix signals. For these systems, <b>SIGCHLD</b> is not be
auto-matically reenabled. After a <b>SIGCHLD</b> signal is
received, a call to <b>wait</b> must be performed to retrieve the
exit status of the child process before issuing another
<b>signal</b> <b>SIGCHLD</b> <i>...</i> command. For code that is
to be portable between both types of systems, use this
approach.</p>

<p>Signals are not processed until after the completion of the Tcl
command that is executing when the signal is received. If an
interactive Tcl shell is running, then the <b>SIGINT</b> will be
set to <b>error</b>, non-interactive Tcl sessions leave
<b>SIGINT</b> unchanged from when the process started (normally
<b>default</b> for foreground pro-cesses and <b>ignore</b> for
processes in the background).</p>

<p><b>sleep</b> <i>seconds</i><br>
 Sleep the Extended Tcl process for <i>seconds</i> seconds.
<i>Seconds,</i> <i>if</i> <i>specified</i> <i>as</i> <i>a</i>
<i>decimal</i> <i>number,</i> <i>is</i> <i>truncated</i> <i>to</i>
<i>an</i> <i>integer</i> <i>value.</i></p>

<p><b>system</b> <i>cmdstr1</i> ?<i>cmdstr2</i>...?<br>
 Concatenates <i>cmdstr1</i>, <i>cmdstr2</i> etc with space
separators (see the <b>concat</b> command) into a single command
and then evaluates the command using the standard system shell. On
Unix systems, this is <b>/bin/sh</b> and on Windows its
<b>command.com</b>. The exit code of the command is returned.</p>

<p>This command differs from the <b>exec</b> command in that
<b>system</b> doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t return the executed
command&acirc;&euro;&trade;s standard output as the result string,
and <b>system</b> goes through the Unix shell to provide wild card
expansion, redirection, etc, as is normal from an <b>sh</b> command
line.</p>

<p><b>sync</b> ?<i>fileId</i>?</p>

<p>If <i>fileId</i> is not specified, or if it is and this system
does not support the <i>fsync</i> system call, issues a <i>sync</i>
system call to flush all pending disk output. If <i>fileId</i> is
specified and the system does support the <i>fsync</i> system call,
issues an <i>fsync</i> on the file corresponding to the specified
Tcl <i>fileId</i> to force all pending output to that file out to
the disk.</p>

<p>If <i>fileId</i> is specified, the file must be writable. A
<b>flush</b> will be issued against the <i>fileId</i> before the
sync.</p>

<p>The <i>infox</i> <i>have</i><b>_</b><i>fsync</i> command can be
used to determine if <b>sync</b> <i>fileId</i> will do a
<i>sync</i> or a <i>fsync</i>.</p>

<p><b>times</b><br>
 Return a list containing the process and child execution times in
the form:<br>
 <i>utime</i> <i>stime</i> <i>cutime</i> <i>cstime</i><br>
 Also see the <a href='http://localhost/activetcl/8.6/tcl/tclx/times.2.html'>times(2)</a> system call
manual page. The values are in milliseconds.</p>

<p><b>umask</b> ?<i>octalmask</i>?<br>
 Sets file-creation mode mask to the octal value of
<i>octalmask</i>. If <i>octalmask</i> is omitted, the current mask
is returned.</p>

<p><b>wait</b> ?<b>-nohang</b>? ?<b>-untraced</b>? ?<b>-pgroup</b>?
?<i>pid</i>? Waits for a process created with the <b>execl</b>
command to terminate, either due to an untrapped signal or call to
<i>exit</i> system call. If the process id <i>pid</i> is specified,
they wait on that process, otherwise wait on any child process to
terminate.</p>

<p>If <b>-nohang</b> is specified, then don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t
block waiting on a process to terminate. If no process is
immediately available, return an empty list. If <b>-untraced</b> is
specified then the status of child processes that are stopped, and
whose status has not yet been reported since they stopped, are also
returned. If <b>-pgroup</b> is specified and <i>pid</i> is not
specified, then wait on any child pro-cess whose process group ID
is they same as the calling process. If <i>pid</i> is specified
with <b>-pgroup</b>, then it is take as a process group ID, waiting
on any process in that process group to termi-nate.</p>

<p><b>Wait</b> returns a list containing three elements: The first
element is the process id of the process that terminated. If the
pro-cess exited normally, the second element is
&acirc;&euro;&tilde;EXIT&acirc;&euro;&trade;, and the third
contains the numeric exit code. If the process terminated due to a
signal, the second element is
&acirc;&euro;&tilde;SIG&acirc;&euro;&trade;, and the third
con-tains the signal name. If the process is currently stopped (on
systems that support SIGSTP), the second element is
&acirc;&euro;&tilde;STOP&acirc;&euro;&trade;, fol-lowed by the
signal name.</p>

<p>Note that it is possible to wait on processes to terminate that
were create in the background with the <b>exec</b> command.
However, if any other <b>exec</b> command is executed after the
process termi-nates, then the process status will be reaped by the
<b>exec</b> com-mand and will not be available to the <b>wait</b>
command.</p>

<p>On systems without the <b>waitpid</b> system call, the
<b>-nohang</b>, <b>-untraced</b> and <b>-pgroup</b> options are not
available. The <b>infox</b> <b>have_waitpid</b> command maybe use
to determine if this functional-ity is available.</p>

<h2><a name='sect6' href='TclX.n.html#toc6'><b>File</b>
<b>Commands</b></a></h2>

<p>These commands provide extended file access and manipulation.
This includes searching ASCII-sorted data files, copying files,
duplicating file descriptors, control of file access options,
retrieving open file status, and creating pipes with the
<b>pipe</b> system call. Also linking files, setting file, process,
and user attributes and truncating files. An interface to the
<b>select</b> system call is available on Unix systems that support
it.</p>

<p>It should be noted that Tcl file I/O is implemented on top of
the stdio library. By default, the file is buffered. When
communicating to a process through a pipe, a <b>flush</b> command
should be issued to force the data out. Alternatively, the
<b>fcntl</b> command may be used to set the buffering mode of a
file to line-buffered or unbuffered.</p>

<p><b>bsearch</b> <i>fileId</i> <i>key</i> ?<i>retvar</i>?
?<i>compare</i><b>_</b><i>proc</i>? Search an opened file
<i>fileId</i> containing lines of text sorted into ascending order
for a match. <i>Key</i> contains the string to match. If
<i>retvar</i> is specified, then the line from the file is returned
in <i>retvar</i>, and the command returns <b>1</b> if <i>key</i>
was found, and <b>0</b> if it wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t. If
<i>retvar</i> is not specified or is a null name, then the command
returns the line that was found, or an empty string if <i>key</i>
wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t found.</p>

<p>By default, the key is matched against the first white-space
separated field in each line. The field is treated as an ASCII
string. If <i>compare</i><b>_</b><i>proc</i> is specified, then it
defines the name of a Tcl procedure to evaluate against each line
read from the sorted file during the execution of the
<b>bsearch</b> command. <i>Com-pare</i><b>_</b><i>proc</i> takes
two arguments, the key and a line extracted from the file. The
compare routine should return a number less than zero if the key is
less than the line, zero if the key matches the line, or greater
than zero if the key is greater than the line. The file must be
sorted in ascending order according to the same criteria
<i>compare</i><b>_</b><i>proc</i> uses to compare the key with the
line, or erroneous results will occur.</p>

<p>This command does not work on files containing binary data
(bytes of zero).</p>

<p><b>chmod</b> [<b>-fileid</b>] <i>mode</i> <i>filelist</i><br>
 Set permissions of each of the files in the list <i>filelist</i>
to <i>mode</i>, where <i>mode</i> is an absolute numeric mode or
symbolic permis-sions as in the UNIX <a href=
'http://localhost/activetcl/8.6/tcl/tclx/chmod.1.html'>chmod(1)</a> command. To specify a mode as octal, it
should be prefixed with a 0 (e.g. 0622).</p>

<p>If the option <b>-fileid</b> is specified, <i>filelist</i> is a
list of open file identifiers rather than a list of file names.
This option is not available on all Unix systems. Use the
<b>infox</b> <b>have_fchmod</b> command to determine if this
functionality is available.</p>

<p>The <b>chmod</b> command is not available on <b>Windows</b>.</p>

<p><b>chown</b> [<b>-fileid</b>] <i>owner</i> | {<i>owner</i>
<i>group</i>} <i>filelist</i> Set owner of each file in the list
<i>filelist</i> to <i>owner</i>, which can be a user name or
numeric user id. If the first parameter is a list, then the owner
is set to the first element of the list and the group is set to the
second element. <i>Group</i> can be a group name or numeric group
id. If <i>group</i> is {}, then the file group will be set to the
login group of the specified user.</p>

<p>If the option <b>-fileid</b> is specified, <i>filelist</i> is a
list of open file identifiers rather than a list of file names.
This option is not available on all Unix systems. Use the
<b>infox</b> <b>have_fchown</b> command to determine if this
functionality is available.</p>

<p>The <b>chown</b> command is not available on <b>Windows</b>.</p>

<p><b>chgrp</b> [<b>-fileid</b>] <i>group</i> <i>filelist</i><br>
 Set the group id of each file in the list <i>filelist</i> to
<i>group</i>, which can be either a group name or a numeric group
id.</p>

<p>If the option <b>-fileid</b> is specified, <i>filelist</i> is a
list of open file identifiers rather than a list of file names.
This option is not available on all Unix systems. Use the
<b>infox</b> <b>have_fchown</b> command to determine if this
functionality is available.</p>

<p>The <b>chgrp</b> command is not available on <b>Windows</b>.</p>

<p><b>dup</b> <i>fileId</i> ?<i>targetFileId</i>?<br>
 Duplicate an open file. A new file id is opened that addresses the
same file as <i>fileId</i>.</p>

<p>If <i>targetFileId</i> is specified, the the file is dup to this
speci-fied file id. Normally this is <b>stdin</b>, <b>stdout</b>,
or <b>stderr</b>. The dup command will handle flushing output and
closing this file. The new file will be buffered, if its needs to
be unbuffered, use the <b>fcntl</b> command to set it
unbuffered.</p>

<p>If <i>fileId</i> is a number rather than a Tcl file id, then the
<b>dup</b> command will bind that file to a Tcl file id. This is
useful for accessing files that are passed from the parent process.
The argument ?<i>targetFileId</i>? is not valid with this
operation.</p>

<p>On <b>Windows</b>, only <b>stdin</b>, <b>stdout</b>, or
<b>stderr</b> or a non-socket file handle number maybe specified
for <i>targetFileId</i>. The <b>dup</b> command does not work on
sockets on <b>Windows</b>.</p>

<p><b>fcntl</b> <i>fileId</i> <i>attribute</i> <i>?value</i>?<br>
 This command either sets or clears a file option or returns its
current value. If <i>value</i> is not specified, then the current
value of <b>attribute</b> is returned. All values are boolean. Some
attributes maybe only be gotten, not modified. The following
attributes may be specified:</p>

<p><b>RDONLY</b> The file is opened for reading only. (Get
only)</p>

<p><b>WRONLY</b> The file is opened for writing only. (Get
only)</p>

<p><b>RDWR</b> The file is opened for reading and writing. (Get
only)</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>READ</b></dt>

<dd>If the file is readable. (Get only).</dd>
</dl>

<p><b>WRITE</b> If the file is writable. (Get only).</p>

<p><b>APPEND</b> The file is opened for append-only writes. All
writes will be forced to the end of the file. (Get or set).</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>NONBLOCK</b></dt>

<dd>The file is to be accessed with non-blocking I/O. See the
<b>read</b> system call for a description of how it affects the
behavior of file reads.</dd>

<dt><b>CLOEXEC</b></dt>

<dd>Close the file on an process exec. If the <b>execl</b> command
or some other mechanism causes the process to do an exec, the file
will be closed if this option is set.</dd>
</dl>

<p><b>NOBUF</b> The file is not buffered. If set, then there no
buffering for the file.</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>LINEBUF</b></dt>

<dd>Output the file will be line buffered. The buffer will be
flushed when a newline is written, when the buffer is full, or when
input is requested.</dd>

<dt><b>KEEPALIVE</b></dt>

<dd>Keep a socket connection alive. If SIGPIPE is enabled, then it
is sent if connection is broken and data is written to the socket.
If SIGPIPE is ignored, an error is returned on the write. This
attribute is valid only on sockets. By default, SIGPIPE is ignored
in Tcl.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The <b>NONBLOCK</b>, <b>NOBUF</b> and <b>LINEBUF</b> are
provided for compatibility with older scripts. The<b>fconfigure</b>
command is preferred method of getting and setting these
attributes.</p>

<p>The <b>APPEND</b> and <b>CLOEXEC</b> options are not available
on <b>Windows</b>.</p>

<p><b>flock</b> <i>options</i> <i>fileId</i> ?<i>start</i>?
?<i>length</i>? ?<i>origin</i>?</p>

<p>This command places a lock on all or part of the file specified
by <i>fileId</i>. The lock is either advisory or mandatory,
depending on the mode bits of the file. The lock is placed
beginning at relative byte offset <i>start</i> for <i>length</i>
bytes. If <i>start</i> or <i>length</i> is omitted or empty, zero
is assumed. If <i>length</i> is zero, then the lock always extents
to end of file, even if the file grows. If <i>origin</i> is
<b>start</b>", then the offset is relative to the begin-ning of the
file. If it is <b>current</b>", it is relative to the cur-rent
access position in the file. If it is <b>end</b>", then it is
relative to the end-of-file (a negative is before the EOF,
posi-tive is after). If <i>origin</i> is omitted, <b>start</b> is
assumed.</p>

<p>The following <i>options</i> are recognized:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>-read</b></dt>

<dd>Place a read lock on the file. Multiple processes may be
accessing the file with read-locks.</dd>

<dt><b>-write</b> Place a write lock on the file.</dt>

<dd>Only one process may be accessing a file if there is a write
lock.</dd>

<dt><b>-nowait</b></dt>

<dd>If specified, then the process will not block if the lock can
not be obtained. With this option, the command returns 1 if the
lock is obtained and 0 if it is not.</dd>
</dl>

<p>See your system&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <b>fcntl</b> system call
documentation for full details of the behavior of file locking. If
locking is being done on ranges of a file, it is best to use
unbuffered file access (see the <b>fcntl</b> command).</p>

<p>The <b>flock</b> command is not available on <b>Windows</b>
<b>95</b>. It is avail-able on <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b>.</p>

<p><b>for_file</b> <i>var</i> <i>filename</i> <i>code</i><br>
 This procedure implements a loop over the contents of a file. For
each line in <i>filename</i>, it sets <i>var</i> to the line and
executes <i>code</i>.</p>

<p>The <b>break</b> and <b>continue</b> commands work as with
foreach.</p>

<p>For example, the command</p>

<p>for_file line /etc/passwd {echo $line}</p>

<p>would echo all the lines in the password file.</p>

<p><b>funlock</b> <i>fileId</i> ?<i>start</i>? ?<i>length</i>?
?<i>origin</i>? Remove a locked from a file that was previously
placed with the <i>flock</i> command. The arguments are the same as
for the <i>flock</i> com-mand, see that command for more
details.</p>

<p>The <b>funlock</b> command is not available on <b>Windows</b>
<b>95</b>. It is available on <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b>.</p>

<p><b>fstat</b> <i>fileId</i> ?<i>item</i>? | ?<b>stat</b>
<i>arrayvar</i>?</p>

<p>Obtain status information about an open file.</p>

<p>The following keys are used to identify data items:</p>

<p><b>atime</b> The time of last access.</p>

<p><b>ctime</b> The time of last file status change</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>dev</b></dt>

<dd>The device containing a directory for the file. This value
uniquely identifies the file system that contains the file.</dd>

<dt><b>gid</b></dt>

<dd>The group ID of the file&acirc;&euro;&trade;s group.</dd>

<dt><b>ino</b></dt>

<dd>The inode number. This field uniquely identifies the file in a
given file system.</dd>

<dt><b>mode</b></dt>

<dd>The mode of the file (see the <b>mknod</b> system call).</dd>
</dl>

<p><b>mtime</b> Time when the data in the file was last
modified.</p>

<p><b>nlink</b> The number of links to the file.</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>size</b></dt>

<dd>The file size in bytes.</dd>

<dt><b>tty</b></dt>

<dd>If the file is associated with a terminal, then 1 other-wise
0.</dd>
</dl>

<p><b>type</b> The type of the file in symbolic form, which is one
of the following values: <b>file</b>, <b>directory</b>,
<b>characterSpecial</b>, <b>blockSpecial</b>, <b>fifo</b>,
<b>link</b>, or <b>socket</b>.</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>uid</b></dt>

<dd>The user ID of the file&acirc;&euro;&trade;s owner.</dd>
</dl>

<p>If one of these keys is specified as <i>item</i>, then that data
item is returned.</p>

<p>If <b>stat</b> <i>arrayvar</i> is specified, then the
information is returned in the array <i>arrayvar</i>. Each of the
above keys indexes an ele-ment of the array containing the
data.</p>

<p>If only <i>fileId</i> is specified, the command returns the data
as a keyed list.</p>

<p>The following values may be returned only if explicitly asked
for, it will not be returned with the array or keyed list
forms:</p>

<p><b>remotehost</b><br>
 If <i>fileId</i> is a TCP/IP socket connection, then a list is
returned with the first element being the remote host IP address.
If the remote host name can be found, it is returned as the second
element of the list. The remote host IP port number is the third
element.</p>

<p><b>localhost</b><br>
 If <i>fileId</i> is a TCP/IP socket connection, then a list is
returned with the first element being the local host IP address. If
the local host name can be found, it is returned as the second
element of the list. The local host IP port number is the third
element.</p>

<p><b>ftruncate</b> [<b>-fileid</b>] <i>file</i> <i>newsize</i><br>
 Truncate a file to have a length of at most <i>newsize</i>
bytes.</p>

<p>If the option <b>-fileid</b> is specified, <i>file</i> is an
open file identi-fier, otherwise it is a file path.</p>

<p>This command is not available or not fully functional if the
underlying operating system support is not available. The com-mand
<b>infox</b> <b>have_truncate</b> will indicate if this command may
trun-cate by file path. The command <b>infox</b>
<b>have_ftruncate</b> will indi-cate if this command may truncate
by file id.</p>

<p>The <b>-fileid</b> option is not available on
<b>Windows</b>.</p>

<p><b>lgets</b> <i>fileId</i> ?<i>varName</i>?<br>
 Reads the next Tcl list from the file given by <i>fileId</i> and
dis-cards the terminating newline character. This command differs
from the <b>gets</b> command, in that it reads Tcl lists rather
than lines. If the list contains newlines or binary data, then that
newline or bytes of zero will be returned as part of the result.
Only a newline not quoted as part of the list indicates the end of
the list. There is no corresponding command for outputting lists,
as <b>puts</b> will do this correctly.</p>

<p>If <i>varName</i> is specified, then the line is placed in the
variable by that name and the return value is a count of the number
of characters read (not including the newline). If the end of the
file is reached before reading any characters then -1 is returned
and <i>varName</i> is set to an empty string. If <i>varName</i> is
specified and an error occurs, what ever data was read will be
returned in the variable, however the resulting string may not be a
valid list.</p>

<p>If <i>varName</i> is not specified then the return value will be
the line (minus the newline character) or an empty string if the
end of the file is reached before reading any characters. An empty
string will also be returned if a line contains no characters
except the newline, so <b>eof</b> may have to be used to determine
what really happened.</p>

<p>The <b>lgets</b> command maybe used to read and write lists
containing binary data, however translation must be set to
<b>lf</b> or the data maybe corrupted.</p>

<p>If <b>lgets</b> is currently supported on non-blocking
files.</p>

<p><b>pipe</b> ?<i>fileId</i><b>_</b><i>var</i><b>_</b><i>r</i>
<i>fileId</i><b>_</b><i>var</i><b>_</b><i>w</i>?<br>
 Create a pipe. If <i>fileId</i><b>_</b><i>var</i><b>_</b><i>r</i>
and <i>fileId</i><b>_</b><i>var</i><b>_</b><i>r</i> are specified,
then <b>pipe</b> will set the a variable named
<i>fileId</i><b>_</b><i>var</i><b>_</b><i>r</i> to contain the
fileId of the side of the pipe that was opened for reading, and
<i>fileId</i><b>_</b><i>var</i><b>_</b><i>w</i> will contain the
fileId of the side of the pipe that was opened for writing.</p>

<p>If the fileId variables are not specified, then a list
contain-ing the read and write fileIdw is returned as the result of
the command.</p>

<p><b>read_file</b> ?<b>-nonewline</b>? <i>fileName</i></p>

<p><b>read_file</b> <i>fileName</i> <i>numBytes</i><br>
 This procedure reads the file <i>fileName</i> and returns the
contents as a string. If <b>-nonewline</b> is specified, then the
last charac-ter of the file is discarded if it is a newline. The
second form specifies exactly how many bytes will be read and
returned, unless there are fewer than <i>numBytes</i> bytes left in
the file; in this case, all the remaining bytes are returned.</p>

<p><b>select</b> <i>readfileIds</i> ?<i>writefileIds</i>?
?<i>exceptfileIds</i>? ?<i>timeout</i>? This command allows an
Extended Tcl program to wait on zero or more files being ready for
for reading, writing, have an excep-tional condition pending, or
for a timeout period to expire. <i>readFileIds</i>,
<i>writeFileIds</i>, <i>exceptFileIds</i> are each lists of
fileIds, as returned from <b>open</b>, to query. An empty list ({})
may be specified if a category is not used.</p>

<p>The files specified by the <i>readFileIds</i> list are checked
to see if data is available for reading. The <i>writeFileIds</i>
are checked if the specified files are clear for writing. The
<i>exceptFileIds</i> are checked to see if an exceptional condition
has occurred (typically, an error). The write and exception
checking is most useful on devices, however, the read checking is
very useful when communicating with multiple processes through
pipes. Select considers data pending in the stdio input buffer for
read files as being ready for reading, the files do. not have to be
unbuffered.</p>

<p><i>Timeout</i> is a floating point timeout value, in seconds. If
an empty list is supplied (or the parameter is omitted), then no
timeout is set. If the value is zero, then the <b>select</b>
command functions as a poll of the files, returning immediately
even if none are ready.</p>

<p>If the <i>timeout</i> period expires with none of the files
becoming ready, then the command returns an empty list. Otherwise
the command returns a list of three elements, each of those
elements is a list of the fileIds that are ready in the read, write
and exception classes. If none are ready in a class, then that
ele-ment will be the null list. For example:</p>

<p>select {file3 file4 file5} {file6 file7} {} 10.5</p>

<p>could return</p>

<p>{file3 file4} {file6} {}</p>

<p>or perhaps</p>

<p>file3 {} {}</p>

<p>On <b>Windows</b>, only sockets can be used with the
<b>select</b> command. Pipes, as returned by the <b>open</b>
command, are not supported.</p>

<p><b>write_file</b> <i>fileName</i> <i>string</i>
<i>?string...?</i><br>
 This procedure writes the specified strings to the named file.</p>

<h2><a name='sect7' href='TclX.n.html#toc7'><b>Network</b> <b>Programming</b>

<p>TclX provides functionality to complement the Tcl <b>socket</b>
command. The <b>host_info</b> command is used to get information
about a host by name or IP address. In addition, the <b>fstat</b>
and <b>fcntl</b> commands provide options of querying and
controlling connected sockets. To obtain the host name of the

<h2><a name='sect8' href='TclX.n.html#toc8'><b>File</b> <b>Scanning</b>
<b>Commands</b></a></h2>

<p>These commands provide a facility to scan files, matching lines
of the file against regular expressions and executing Tcl code on a
match. With this facility you can use Tcl to do the sort of file
processing that is traditionally done with <i>awk</i>. And since
Tcl&acirc;&euro;&trade;s approach is more declarative, some of the
scripts that can be rather difficult to write in awk are simple to
code in Tcl.</p>

<p>File scanning in Tcl centers around the concept of a <i>scan</i>
<i>context</i>. A scan context contains one or more match
statements, which associate regular expressions to scan for with
Tcl code to be executed when the expressions are matched.</p>

<p><b>scancontext</b> ?<i>option</i>?<br>
 This command manages file scan contexts. A scan context is a
collection of regular expressions and commands to execute when that
regular expression matches a line of the file. A context may also
have a single default match, to be applied against lines that do
not match any of the regular expressions. Multi-ple scan contexts
may be defined and they may be reused on mul-tiple files. A scan
context is identified by a context handle. The <b>scancontext</b>
command takes the following forms:</p>

<p><b>scancontext</b> <b>create</b><br>
 Create a new scan context. The <b>scanmatch</b> command is used to
define patterns in the context. A contexthandle is returned, which
the Tcl programmer uses to refer to the newly created scan context
in calls to the Tcl file scanning commands.</p>

<p><b>scancontext</b> <b>delete</b> <i>contexthandle</i><br>
 Delete the scan context identified by <i>contexthandle</i>, and
free all of the match statements and compiled regular expressions
associated with the specified context.</p>

<p><b>scancontext</b> <b>copyfile</b> <i>contexthandle</i>
?<i>filehandle</i>? Set or return the file handle that unmatched
lines are copied to. (See <b>scanfile</b>). If <i>filehandle</i> is
omitted, the copy file handle is returned. If no copy file is
associated with the con-text, {} is returned. If a file handle is
specified, it becomes the copy file for this context. If
<i>filehandle</i> is {}, then it removes any copy file
specification for the context.</p>

<p><b>scanfile</b> ?<i>-copyfile</i> <i>copyFileId</i>?
<i>contexthandle</i> <i>fileId</i> Scan the file specified by
<i>fileId</i>, starting from the current file position. Check all
patterns in the scan context specified by <i>contexthandle</i>
against it, executing the match commands corre-sponding to patterns
matched.</p>

<p>If the optional <i>-copyfile</i> argument is specified, the next
argu-ment is a file ID to which all lines not matched by any
pattern (excluding the default pattern) are to be written. If the
copy file is specified with this flag, instead of using the
<b>scancon-text</b> <b>copyfile</b> command, the file is
disassociated from the scan context at the end of the scan.</p>

<p>This command does not work on files containing binary data
(bytes of zero).</p>

<p><b>scanmatch</b> ?<i>-nocase</i>? <i>contexthandle</i>
?<i>regexp</i>? <i>commands</i></p>

<p>Specify Tcl <i>commands</i>, to be evaluated when <i>regexp</i>
is matched by a <b>scanfile</b> command. The match is added to the
scan context specified by <i>contexthandle</i>. Any number of match
statements may be specified for a give context. <i>Regexp</i> is a
regular expression (see the <b>regexp</b> command). If
<b>-nocase</b> is specified as the first argument, the pattern is
matched regardless of alphabetic case.</p>

<p>If <i>regexp</i> is not specified, then a default match is
specified for the scan context. The default match will be executed
when a line of the file does not match any of the regular
expressions in the current scancontext.</p>

<p>The array <b>matchInfo</b> is available to the Tcl code that is
exe-cuted when an expression matches (or defaults). It contains
information about the file being scanned and where within it the
expression was matched.</p>

<p><b>matchInfo</b> is local to the top level of the match command
unless declared global at that level by the Tcl <b>global</b>
command. If it is to be used as a global, it <i>must</i> be
declared global before <b>scanfile</b> is called (since
<b>scanfile</b> sets the <b>matchInfo</b> before the match code is
executed, a subsequent <b>global</b> will override the local
variable). The following array entries are available:</p>

<p><a href='http://localhost/activetcl/8.6/tcl/tclx/matchInfo.l.html'>matchInfo(line)</a><br>
 Contains the text of the line of the file that was matched.</p>

<p><a href='http://localhost/activetcl/8.6/tcl/tclx/matchInfo.o.html'>matchInfo(offset)</a><br>
 The byte offset into the file of the first character of the line
that was matched.</p>

<p><a href='http://localhost/activetcl/8.6/tcl/tclx/matchInfo.l.html'>matchInfo(linenum)</a><br>
 The line number of the line that was matched. This is relative to
the first line scanned, which is usually, but not necessarily, the
first line of the file. The first line is line number one.</p>

<p><b>matchInfo(context)</b><br>
 The context handle of the context that this scan is asso-ciated
with.</p>

<p><b>matchInfo(handle)</b><br>
 The file id (handle) of the file currently being scanned.</p>

<p><b>matchInfo(copyHandle)</b><br>
 The file id (handle) of the file specified by the
<b>-copy-file</b> option. The element does not exist if
<b>-copyfile</b> was not specified.</p>

<p><b>matchInfo(submatch0)</b><br>
 Will contain the characters matching the first parenthe-sized
subexpression. The second will be contained in <b>submatch1</b>,
etc.</p>

<p><b>matchInfo(subindex0)</b><br>
 Will contain the a list of the starting and ending indices of the
string matching the first parenthesized subexpression. The second
will be contained in <b>subindex1</b>, etc.</p>

<p>All <b>scanmatch</b> patterns that match a line will be
processed in the order in which their specifications were added to
the scan context. The remainder of the <b>scanmatch</b>
pattern-command pairs may be skipped for a file line if a
<b>continue</b> is executed by the Tcl code of a preceding, matched
pattern.</p>

<p>If a <b>return</b> is executed in the body of the match command,
the <b>scanfile</b> command currently in progress returns, with the
value passed to <b>return</b> as its return value.</p>

<h2><a name='sect9' href='TclX.n.html#toc9'><b>Math</b>
<b>Commands</b></a></h2>

<p>Several extended math commands commands make many additional
math func-tions available in TclX. In addition, a set of procedures
provide com-mand access to the math functions supported by the
<b>expr</b> command.</p>

<p>The following procedures provide command interfaces to the expr
math functions. They take the same arguments as the <b>expr</b>
functions and may take expressions as arguments.</p>

<p><b>abs</b> <b>acos</b> <b>asin</b> <b>atan2</b> <b>atan</b>
<b>ceil</b> <b>cos</b> <b>cosh</b> <b>double</b> <b>exp</b>
<b>floor</b> <b>fmod</b> <b>hypot</b> <b>int</b> <b>log10</b>
<b>log</b> <b>pow</b> <b>round</b> <b>sin</b> <b>sinh</b>
<b>sqrt</b> <b>tan</b> <b>tanh</b></p>

<p><b>max</b> <i>num1</i> ?..<i>numN</i>?</p>

<p><b>expr</b> <b>max(num1,</b> <b>num2)</b><br>
 Returns the argument that has the highest numeric value. Each
argument may be any integer or floating point value.</p>

<p>This functionality is also available as a math function
<b>max</b> in the Tcl <b>expr</b> command.</p>

<p><b>min</b> <i>num1</i> ?..<i>numN</i>?</p>

<p><b>expr</b> <b>min(num1,</b> <b>num2)</b><br>
 Returns the argument that has the lowest numeric value. Each
argument may be any integer or floating point value.</p>

<p>This functionality is also available as a math function
<b>min</b> in the Tcl <b>expr</b> command.</p>

<p><b>random</b> <i>limit</i> | <b>seed</b> ?<i>seedval</i>?<br>
 Generate a pseudorandom integer number greater than or equal to
zero and less than <i>limit</i>. If <b>seed</b> is specified, then
the com-mand resets the random number generator to a starting point
derived from the <b>seedval</b>. This allows one to reproduce
pseudo-random number sequences for testing purposes. If
<i>seedval</i> is omitted, then the seed is set to a value based on
current system state and the current time, providing a reasonably
interesting and ever-changing seed.</p>

<h2><a name='sect10' href='TclX.n.html#toc10'><b>List</b> <b>Manipulation</b>
<b>Commands</b></a></h2>

<p>Extended Tcl provides additional list manipulation commands and
proce-dures.</p>

<p><b>intersect</b> <i>lista</i> <i>listb</i><br>
 Procedure to return the logical intersection of two lists. The
returned list will be sorted.</p>

<p><b>intersect3</b> <i>lista</i> <i>listb</i><br>
 Procedure to intersects two lists, returning a list containing
three lists: The first list returned is everything in <i>lista</i>
that wasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t in <i>listb</i>. The second list
contains the intersection of the two lists, and the third list
contains all the elements that were in <i>listb</i> but
weren&acirc;&euro;&trade;t in <i>lista</i>. The returned lists will
be sorted.</p>

<p><b>lassign</b> <i>list</i> <i>var</i> ?<i>var</i>...?<br>
 Assign successive elements of a list to specified variables. If
there are more variable names than fields, the remaining vari-ables
are set to the empty string. If there are more elements than
variables, a list of the unassigned elements is returned.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>lassign {dave 100 200 {Dave Foo}} name uid gid longName</p>

<p>Assigns <i>name</i> to
&acirc;&euro;&tilde;&acirc;&euro;&tilde;dave&acirc;&euro;&trade;&acirc;&euro;&trade;,
<i>uid</i> to
&acirc;&euro;&tilde;&acirc;&euro;&tilde;100&acirc;&euro;&trade;&acirc;&euro;&trade;,
<i>gid</i> to
&acirc;&euro;&tilde;&acirc;&euro;&tilde;200&acirc;&euro;&trade;&acirc;&euro;&trade;,
and <i>longName</i> to &acirc;&euro;&tilde;&acirc;&euro;&tilde;Dave
Foo&acirc;&euro;&trade;&acirc;&euro;&trade;.</p>

<p><b>lcontain</b> <i>list</i> <i>element</i><br>
 Determine if the <i>element</i> is a list element of <i>list</i>.
If the ele-ment is contained in the list, 1 is returned, otherwise,
0 is returned.</p>

<p><b>lempty</b> <i>list</i><br>
 Determine if the specified list is empty. If empty, 1 is returned,
otherwise, 0 is returned. This command is an alterna-tive to
comparing a list to an empty string, however it checks for a string
of all whitespaces, which is an empty list.</p>

<p><b>lmatch</b> ?<i>mode</i>? <i>list</i> <i>pattern</i></p>

<p>Search the elements of <i>list</i>, returning a list of all
elements matching <i>pattern</i>. If none match, an empty list is
returned.</p>

<p>The <i>mode</i> argument indicates how the elements of the list
are to be matched against <i>pattern</i> and it must have one of
the following values:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>-exact</b> The</dt>

<dd>list element must contain exactly the same string as
<i>pattern</i>.</dd>

<dt><b>-glob</b></dt>

<dd><i>Pattern</i> is a glob-style pattern which is matched against
each list element using the same rules as the <b>string</b>
<b>match</b> command.</dd>

<dt><b>-regexp</b></dt>

<dd><i>Pattern</i> is treated as a regular expression and matched
against each list element using the same rules as the <b>regexp</b>
command.</dd>
</dl>

<p>If <i>mode</i> is omitted then it defaults to <b>-glob</b>.</p>

<p>Only the <b>-exact</b> comparison will work on binary data.</p>

<p><b>lrmdups</b> <i>list</i><br>
 Procedure to remove duplicate elements from a list. The returned
list will be sorted.</p>

<p><b>lvarcat</b> <i>var</i> <i>string</i> <i>?string...</i>?<br>
 This command treats each <i>string</i> argument as a list and
concate-nates them to the end of the contents of <i>var</i>,
forming a a single list. The list is stored back into <i>var</i>
and also returned as the result. if <i>var</i> does not exist, it
is created.</p>

<p><b>lvarpop</b> <i>var</i> ?<i>indexExpr</i>? ?<i>string</i>?<br>
 The <b>lvarpop</b> command pops (deletes) the element indexed by
the expression <i>indexExpr</i> from the list contained in the
variable <i>var</i>. If <i>index</i> is omitted, then 0 is assumed.
If <i>string</i>, is specified, then the deleted element is
replaced by <i>string</i>. The replaced or deleted element is
returned. Thus &acirc;&euro;&tilde;&acirc;&euro;&tilde;lvarpop argv
0&acirc;&euro;&trade;&acirc;&euro;&trade; returns the first element
of argv, setting argv to contain the remainder of the string.</p>

<p>If the expression <i>indexExpr</i> starts with the string
<b>end</b>, then <b>end</b> is replaced with the index of the last
element in the list. If the expression starts with <b>len</b>, then
<b>len</b> is replaced with the length of the list.</p>

<p><b>lvarpush</b> <i>var</i> <i>string</i> ?<i>indexExpr</i>?<br>
 The <b>lvarpush</b> command pushes (inserts) <i>string</i> as an
element in the list contained in the variable <i>var</i>. The
element is inserted before position <i>indexExpr</i> in the list.
If <i>index</i> is omitted, then 0 is assumed. If <i>var</i> does
not exists, it is created.</p>

<p>If the expression <i>indexExpr</i> starts with the string
<b>end</b>, then <b>end</b> is replaced with the index of the last
element in the list. If the expression starts with <b>len</b>, then
<b>len</b> is replaced with the length of the list. Note the a
value of <b>end</b> means insert the string before the last
element.</p>

<p><b>union</b> <i>lista</i> <i>listb</i><br>
 Procedure to return the logical union of the two specified lists.
Any duplicate elements are removed.</p>

<h2><a name='sect11' href='TclX.n.html#toc11'><b>Keyed</b>
<b>Lists</b></a></h2>

<p>Extended Tcl defines a special type of list referred to as
<i>keyed</i> <i>lists</i>. These lists provided a structured data
type built upon standard Tcl lists. This provides a functionality
similar to <i>struct</i>s in the C pro-gramming language.</p>

<p>A keyed list is a list in which each element contains a key and
value pair. These element pairs are stored as lists themselves,
where the key is the first element of the list, and the value is
the second. The key-value pairs are referred to as <i>fields</i>.
This is an example of a keyed list:</p>

<p>{{NAME {Frank Zappa}} {JOB {musician and composer}}}</p>

<p>If the variable <b>person</b> contained the above list, then
<b>keylget</b> <b>person</b> <b>NAME</b> would return <b>{Frank</b>
<b>Zappa}</b>. Executing the command:</p>

<p>keylset person ID 106</p>

<p>would make <b>person</b> contain</p>

<p>{{ID 106} {NAME {Frank Zappa}} {JOB {musician and composer}}</p>

<p>Fields may contain subfields;
&acirc;&euro;&tilde;.&acirc;&euro;&trade; is the separator
character. Sub-fields are actually fields where the value is
another keyed list. Thus the following list has the top level
fields <i>ID</i> and <i>NAME</i>, and subfields <i>NAME.FIRST</i>
and <i>NAME.LAST</i>:</p>

<p>{ID 106} {NAME {{FIRST Frank} {LAST Zappa}}}</p>

<p>There is no limit to the recursive depth of subfields, allowing
one to build complex data structures.</p>

<p>Keyed lists are constructed and accessed via a number of
commands. All keyed list management commands take the name of the
variable containing the keyed list as an argument (i.e. passed by
reference), rather than passing the list directly.</p>

<p><b>keyldel</b> <i>listvar</i> <i>key</i><br>
 Delete the field specified by <i>key</i> from the keyed list in
the variable <i>listvar</i>. This removes both the key and the
value from the keyed list.</p>

<p><b>keylget</b> <i>listvar</i> ?<i>key</i>? ?<i>retvar</i> |
{}?<br>
 Return the value associated with <i>key</i> from the keyed list in
the variable <i>listvar</i>. If <i>retvar</i> is not specified,
then the value will be returned as the result of the command. In
this case, if <i>key</i> is not found in the list, an error will
result.</p>

<p>If <i>retvar</i> is specified and <i>key</i> is in the list,
then the value is returned in the variable <i>retvar</i> and the
command returns <b>1</b> if the key was present within the list. If
<i>key</i> isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t in the list, the command will
return <b>0</b>, and <i>retvar</i> will be left unchanged. If
<b>{}</b> is specified for <i>retvar</i>, the value is not
returned, allowing the Tcl programmer to determine if a key is
present in a keyed list without setting a variable as a
side-effect.</p>

<p>If <i>key</i> is omitted, then a list of all the keys in the
keyed list is returned.</p>

<p><b>keylkeys</b> <i>listvar</i> ?<i>key</i>?<br>
 Return the a list of the keys in the keyed list in the variable
<i>listvar</i>. If <i>keys</i> is specified, then it is the name of
a key field who&acirc;&euro;&trade;s subfield keys are to be
retrieve.</p>

<p><b>keylset</b> <i>listvar</i> <i>key</i> <i>value</i>
?<i>key2</i> <i>value2</i> ...? Set the value associated with
<i>key</i>, in the keyed list contained in the variable
<i>listvar</i>, to <i>value</i>. If listvar does not exists, it is
created. If <i>key</i> is not currently in the list, it will be
added. If it already exists, <i>value</i> replaces the existing
value. Multiple keywords and values may be specified, if
desired.</p>

<h2><a name='sect12' href='TclX.n.html#toc12'><b>String</b> <b>and</b>
<b>Character</b> <b>Manipulation</b> <b>Commands</b></a></h2>

<p>The commands provide additional functionality to classify
characters, convert characters between character and numeric
values, index into a string, determine the length of a string,
extract a range of character from a string, replicate a string a
number of times, and transliterate a string (similar to the Unix
<i>tr</i> program).</p>

<p><b>ccollate</b> ?<i>-local</i>? <i>string1</i>
<i>string2</i><br>
 This command compares two strings. If returns <b>-1</b> if
<i>string1</i> is less than <i>string2</i>, <b>0</b> if they are
equal and <b>1</b> if <i>string1</i> is greater than
<i>string2</i>.</p>

<p>If <b>-local</b> is specified, the strings are compared
according to the collation environment of the current locale.</p>

<p>This command does not work with binary or UTF data.</p>

<p><b>cconcat</b> ?<i>string1</i>? ?<i>string2</i>? ?...?<br>
 Concatenate the arguments, returning the resulting string. While
string concatenation is normally performed by the parser, it is
occasionally useful to have a command that returns a string. The is
generally useful when a command to evaluate is required. No
separators are inserted between the strings.</p>

<p>This command is UTF-aware.</p>

<p><b>cequal</b> <i>string</i> <i>string</i><br>
 This command compares two strings for equality. It returns
<b>1</b> if <i>string1</i> and <i>string2</i> are the identical and
<b>0</b> if they are not. This command is a short-cut for
<b>string</b> <b>compare</b> and avoids the problems with string
expressions being treated unintentionally as numbers.</p>

<p>This command is UTF-aware and will also work on binary data.</p>

<p><b>cindex</b> <i>string</i> <i>indexExpr</i><br>
 Returns the character indexed by the expression <i>indexExpr</i>
(zero based) from <i>string</i>.</p>

<p>If the expression <i>indexExpr</i> starts with the string
<b>end</b>, then <b>end</b> is replaced with the index of the last
character in the string. If the expression starts with <b>len</b>,
then <b>len</b> is replaced with the length of the string.</p>

<p>This command is UTF-aware.</p>

<p><b>clength</b> <i>string</i><br>
 Returns the length of <i>string</i> in characters. This command is
a shortcut for:<br>
 string length string</p>

<p>This command is UTF-aware.</p>

<p><b>crange</b> <i>string</i> <i>firstExpr</i> <i>lastExpr</i><br>
 Returns a range of characters from <i>string</i> starting at the
char-acter indexed by the expression <i>firstExpr</i> (zero-based)
until the character indexed by the expression <i>lastExpr</i>.</p>

<p>If the expression <i>firstExpr</i> or <b>lastExpr</b> starts
with the string <b>end</b>, then <b>end</b> is replaced with the
index of the last character in the string. If the expression starts
with <b>len</b>, then <b>len</b> is replaced with the length of the
string.</p>

<p>This command is UTF-aware.</p>

<p><b>csubstr</b> <i>string</i> <i>firstExpr</i>
<i>lengthExpr</i><br>
 Returns a range of characters from <i>string</i> starting at the
char-acter indexed by the expression <i>firstExpr</i> (zero-based)
for <i>lengthExpr</i> characters.</p>

<p>If the expression <i>firstExpr</i> or <b>lengthExpr</b> starts
with the string <b>end</b>, then <b>end</b> is replaced with the
index of the last character in the string. If the expression starts
with <b>len</b>, then <b>len</b> is replaced with the length of the
string.</p>

<p>This command is UTF-aware.</p>

<p><b>ctoken</b> <i>strvar</i> <i>separators</i><br>
 Parse a token out of a character string. The string to parse is
contained in the variable named <i>strvar</i>. The string
<i>separators</i> contains all of the valid separator characters
for tokens in the string. All leading separators are skipped and
the first token is returned. The variable <i>strvar</i> will be
modified to contain the remainder of the string following the
token.</p>

<p>This command does not work with binary data.</p>

<p><b>ctype</b> <i>?-failindex</i> <i>var?</i> <i>class</i>
<i>string</i><br>
 <b>ctype</b> determines whether all characters in <i>string</i>
are of the specified <i>class</i>. It returns <b>1</b> if they are
all of <i>class</i>, and <b>0</b> if they are not, or if the string
is empty. This command also provides another method (besides
<b>format</b> and <b>scan</b>) of converting between an ASCII
character and its numeric value. The following <b>ctype</b>
commands are available:</p>

<p><b>ctype</b> <i>?-failindex</i> <i>var?</i> <i>alnum</i>
<i>string</i> Tests that all characters are alphabetic or numeric
char-acters as defined by the character set.</p>

<p><b>ctype</b> <i>?-failindex</i> <i>var?</i> <i>alpha</i>
<i>string</i> Tests that all characters are alphabetic characters
as defined by the character set.</p>

<p><b>ctype</b> <i>?-failindex</i> <i>var?</i> <i>ascii</i>
<i>string</i> Tests that all characters are an ASCII character (a
non-negative number less than 0200).</p>

<p><b>ctype</b> <b>char</b> <i>number</i><br>
 Converts the numeric value, <i>string</i>, to an ASCII charac-ter.
Number must be in the range 0 through the maximum Unicode
values.</p>

for which <i>ctype</i> <i>print</i> is true, except for space
characters.</p>

<p><b>ctype</b> <i>?-failindex</i> <i>var?</i> <i>lower</i>
<i>string</i> Tests that all characters are lowercase letters as
defined by the character set.</p>

<p><b>ctype</b> <b>ord</b> <i>character</i><br>
 Convert a character into its decimal numeric value. The first
character of the string is converted to its numeric Unicode
value.</p>

<p><b>ctype</b> <i>?-failindex</i> <i>var?</i> <i>space</i>
<i>string</i> Tests that all characters are either a space,
horizontal-tab, carriage return, newline, vertical-tab, or

character set.</p>

<p><b>ctype</b> <i>?-failindex</i> <i>var?</i> <i>punct</i>
<i>string</i> Tests that all characters are made up of any of the
char-acters other than the ones for which <b>alnum</b>,
<b>cntrl</b>, or <b>space</b> is true.</p>

<i>string</i> Tests that all characters are uppercase letters as
defined by the character set.</p>

<p><b>ctype</b> <i>?-failindex</i> <i>var?</i> <i>xdigit</i>
<i>string</i> Tests that all characters are valid hexadecimal
digits, that is <i>0</i> through <i>9</i>, a through <i>f</i> or
<i>A</i> through <i>F</i>.</p>

<p>If <i>-failindex</i> is specified, then the index into
<i>string</i> of the first character that did not match the class
is returned in <i>var</i>.</p>

<p><b>replicate</b> <i>string</i> <i>countExpr</i><br>
 Returns <i>string</i>, replicated the number of times indicated by
the expression <i>countExpr</i>.</p>

<p>This command is UTF-aware and will work with binary data.</p>

<p><b>translit</b> <i>inrange</i> <i>outrange</i> <i>string</i><br>
 Translate characters in <i>string</i>, changing characters
occurring in <i>inrange</i> to the corresponding character in

characters or a range in the form
&acirc;&euro;&tilde;A-M&acirc;&euro;&trade;. For example:<br>
 translit a-z A-Z foobar</p>

<p>This command currently only supports characters in ASCII range;
UTF-8 characters out of this range will generate an error.</p>

<h2><a name='sect13' href='TclX.n.html#toc13'><b>XPG/3</b> <b>Message</b>
<b>Catalog</b> <b>Commands</b></a></h2>

<p>These commands provide a Tcl interface to message catalogs that
are compliant with the X/Open Portability Guide, Version 3
(XPG/3).</p>

<p>Tcl programmers can use message catalogs to create applications
that are language-independent. Through the use of message catalogs,
prompts, messages, menus and so forth can exist for any number of
lan-guages, and they can altered, and new languages added, without
affect-ing any Tcl or C source code, greatly easing the maintenance
difficul-ties incurred by supporting multiple languages.</p>

<p>A default text message is passed to the command that fetches
entries from message catalogs. This allows the Tcl programmer to
create mes-sage catalogs containing messages in various languages,
but still have a set of default messages available regardless of
the presence of any message catalogs, and allow the programs to
press on without difficulty when no catalogs are present.</p>

<p>Thus, the normal approach to using message catalogs is to ignore
errors on <b>catopen</b>, in which case <b>catgets</b> will return
the default message that was specified in the call.</p>

<p>The Tcl message catalog commands normally ignore most errors. If
it is desirable to detect errors, a special option is provided.
This is nor-mally used only during debugging, to insure that
message catalogs are being used. If your Unix implementation does
not have XPG/3 message catalog support, stubs will be compiled in
that will create a version of <b>catgets</b> that always returns
the default string. This allows for easy porting of software to
environments that don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have support for message
catalogs.</p>

<p>Message catalogs are global to the process, an application with
multi-ple Tcl interpreters within the same process may pass and
share message catalog handles.</p>

<p><b>catopen</b> ?<b>-fail</b> | <b>-nofail</b>?
<i>catname</i><br>
 Open the message catalog <i>catname</i>. This may be a relative
path name, in which case the <b>NLSPATH</b> environment variable is
searched to find an absolute path to the message catalog. A handle
in the form <b>msgcat</b><i>N</i> is returned. Normally, errors are
ignored, and in the case of a failed call to <b>catopen</b>, a
handle is returned to an unopened message catalog. (This handle may
still be passed to <b>catgets</b> and <b>catclose</b>, causing
<b>catgets</b> to simply return the default string, as described
above. If the <b>-fail</b> option is specified, an error is
returned if the open fails. The option <b>-nofail</b> specifies the
default behavior of not returning an error when <b>catopen</b>
fails to open a specified message catalog. If the handle from a
failed <b>catopen</b> is passed to <b>catgets</b>, the default
string is returned.</p>

<p><b>catgets</b> <i>catHandle</i> <i>setnum</i> <i>msgnum</i>
<i>defaultstr</i> Retrieve a message form a message catalog.
<i>CatHandle</i> should be a Tcl message catalog handle that was
returned by <b>catopen</b>. <i>Setnum</i> is the message set
number, and <i>msgnum</i> is the message number. If the message
catalog was not opened, or the message set or mes-sage number
cannot be found, then the default string, <i>default-str</i>, is
returned.</p>

<p><b>catclose</b> ?<b>-fail</b> | <b>-nofail</b>?
<i>cathandle</i><br>
 Close the message catalog specified by <i>cathandle</i>. Normally,
errors are ignored. If <b>-fail</b> is specified, any errors
closing the message catalog file are returned. The option
<b>-nofail</b> spec-ifies the default behavior of not returning an
error. The use of <b>-fail</b> only makes sense if it was also
specified in the call to <b>catopen</b>.</p>

<p><b>mainloop</b><br>
 This procedure sets up a top-level event loop. Events are
pro-cessed until there are no more active event sources, at which
time the process exits. It is used to build event oriented
pro-grams using the TclX shell in a style similar to that used with
<b>wish</b>. If the global variable <b>tcl_interactive</b> exists
and has a true value an interactive command handler is started as
well. If the command handler is terminated by an EOF, the process
will be exited.</p>

<h2><a name='sect14' href='TclX.n.html#toc14'><b>Help</b>
<b>Facility</b></a></h2>

<p>The help facility allows one to look up help pages which where
extracted from the standard Tcl manual pages and Tcl scripts during
Tcl installation. Help files are structured as a multilevel tree of
sub-jects and help pages. Help files are found by searching
directories named <b>help</b> in the directories listed in the
<b>auto_path</b> variable. All of the files in the list of help
directories form a virtual root of the help tree. This method
allows multiple applications to provide help trees without having
the files reside in the same directory.</p>

<p>The help facility can be accessed in two ways, as interactive
commands in the Extended Tcl shell or as an interactive Tk-based
program (if you have built Extended Tcl with Tk).</p>

<p>To run the Tk-based interactive help program:</p>

<p>tclhelp ?addpaths?</p>

<p>Where <i>addpaths</i> are additional paths to search for help
directories. By default, only the <i>auto</i><b>_</b><i>path</i>
used by <b>tclhelp</b> is search. This will result in help on Tcl,
Extended Tcl and Tk.</p>

<p>The following interactive Tcl commands and options are provided
with the help package:</p>

<p><b>help</b><br>
 Help, without arguments, lists of all the help subjects and pages
under the current help subject.</p>

<p><b>help</b> <i>subject</i><br>
 Displays all of help pages and lower level subjects (if any exist)
under the subject <i>subject</i>.</p>

<p><b>help</b> <i>subject/helppage</i><br>
 Display the specified help page. The help output is passed through
a simple pager if output exceeds 23 lines, pausing wait-ing for a
return to be entered. If any other character is entered, the output
is terminated.</p>

<p><b>helpcd</b> ?<i>subject</i>?<br>
 Change the current subject, which is much like the Unix current
directory. If <i>subject</i> is not specified, return to the
top-level of the help tree. Help subject path names may also
include
&acirc;&euro;&tilde;&acirc;&euro;&tilde;..&acirc;&euro;&trade;&acirc;&euro;&trade;
elements.</p>

<p><b>helppwd</b><br>
 Displays the current help subject.</p>

<p><b>help</b> <i>help</i> | ?<br>
 Displays help on the help facility at any directory level.</p>

<p><b>apropos</b> <i>pattern</i><br>
 This command locates subjects by searching their one-line
descriptions for a pattern. Apropos is useful when you can remember
part of the name or description of a command, and want to search
through the one-line summaries for matching lines. Full regular
expressions may be specified (see the <b>regexp</b> com-mand).</p>

<h2><a name='sect15' href='TclX.n.html#toc15'><b>Tcl</b> <b>Loadable</b>
<b>Libraries</b> <b>and</b> <b>Packages</b></a></h2>

<p>Extended Tcl supports standard Tcl <b>tclIndex</b> libraries and
package libraries. A package library file can contain multiple
independent Tcl packages. A package is a named collection of
related Tcl procedures and initialization code.</p>

<p>The package library file is just a regular Unix text file,
editable with your favorite text editor, containing packages of Tcl
source code. The package library file name must have the suffix
<b>.tlib</b>. An index file with the same prefix name and the
suffix <b>.tndx</b> resides the same directory as the <b>.tlib</b>
file. The <b>.tndx</b> will be automatically created whenever it is
out of date or missing (provided there is write access to the
directory).</p>

<p>The variable <b>auto_path</b> contains a list of directories
that are searched for libraries. The first time an unknown command
trap is take, the indexes for the libraries are loaded into memory.
If the <b>auto_path</b> variable is changed during execution of a
program, it will be re-searched. Only the first package of a given
name found during the exe-cution of a program is loaded. This can
be overridden with <b>loadli-bindex</b> command.</p>

<p>The start of a package is delimited by:</p>

<p><b>#@package</b>: <i>package</i><b>_</b><i>name</i> <i>proc1</i>
?<i>..procN</i>?</p>

<p>These lines must start in column one. Everything between the
<b>#@pack-age:</b> keyword and the next <b>#@package:</b> keyword
or a <b>#@packend</b> keyword, or the end of the file, becomes part
of the named package. The specified procedures,
<i>proc1..procN</i>, are the entry points of the package. When a
command named in a package specification is executed and detected
as an unknown command, all code in the specified package will be
sourced. This package should define all of the procedures named on
the package line, define any support procedures required by the
package and do any package-specific initialization. Packages
declarations maybe continued on subsequent lines using standard Tcl
backslash line continuations. The <b>#@packend</b> keyword is
useful to make sure only the minimum required section of code is
sourced. Thus for example a large comment block at the beginning of
the next file won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be loaded.</p>

<p>Care should be taken in defining
<i>package</i><b>_</b><i>name</i>, as the first package found in
the path by with a given name is loaded. This can be useful in
developing new version of packages installed on the system.</p>

<p>For example, in a package source file, the presence of the
following line:</p>

<p><b>#@package:</b> <b>directory_stack</b> <b>pushd</b>
<b>popd</b> <b>dirs</b></p>

<p>says that the text lines following that line in the package file
up to the next <i>package</i> line or the end of the file is a
package named <b>direc-tory_stack</b> and that an attempt to
execute either <i>pushd</i>, <i>popd</i> or <i>dirs</i> when the
routine is not already defined will cause the
<b>directory_stack</b> portion of the package file to be
loaded.</p>

<h2><a name='sect16' href='TclX.n.html#toc16'><b>Package</b> <b>Library</b>
<b>Management</b> <b>Commands</b></a></h2>

<p>Several commands are available for building and managing package
libraries. Commands that are extended versions of the standard Tcl
library commands are listed here. All of the standard Tcl library
man-agement commands and variables are also supported.</p>

<p><b>auto_commands</b> ?<b>-loaders</b>?<br>
 Lists the names of all known loadable procedures and commands
procedures. If <b>-loaders</b> is specified, the command that will
be executed to load the command will also be returned.</p>

<p><b>buildpackageindex</b> <i>libfilelist</i><br>
 Build index files for package libraries. The argument
<i>lib-filelist</i> is a list of package libraries. Each name must
end with the suffix <b>.tlib</b>. A corresponding <b>.tndx</b> file
will be built. The user must have write access to the directory
con-taining each library.</p>

<p><b>convert_lib</b> <i>tclIndex</i> <i>packagelib</i>
<i>?ignore?</i> Convert a Ousterhout style <i>tclIndex</i> index
file and associate source files into a package library
<b>packagelib</b>. If <b>packagelib</b> does not have a
<b>.tlib</b> extension, one will be added. Any files specified in
<i>tclIndex</i> that are in the list <i>ignore</i> will be skipped.
Files listed in <i>ignore</i> should just be the base file names,
not full paths.</p>

<p><b>loadlibindex</b> <i>libfile.tlib</i><br>
 Load the package library index of the library file <b>libfile</b>
(which must have the suffix <i>.tlib</i>). Package library indexes
along the <b>auto_path</b> are loaded automatically on the first
<b>demand_load</b>; this command is provided to explicitly load
libraries that are not in the path. If the index file (with a
<i>.tndx</i> suffix) does not exists or is out of date, it will be
rebuilt if the user has directory permissions to create it. If a
package with the same name as a package in <i>libfile.tlib</i> has
already been loaded, its definition will be overridden by the new
package. However, if any procedure has actually been used from the
previously defined package, the procedures from
<i>lib-file.tlib</i> will not be loaded.</p>

<p><b>auto_packages</b> ?<i>-location</i>?<br>
 Returns a list of the names of all defined packages. If
<i>-loca-tion</i> is specified, a list of pairs of package name and
the <b>.tlib</b> path name, offset and length of the package within
the library.</p>

<p><b>auto_load_file</b> <i>file</i><br>
 Source a file, as with the <b>source</b> command, except search
<b>auto_path</b> for the file.</p>

<p><b>searchpath</b> <i>path</i> <i>file</i><br>
 Search all directories in the specified path, which is a Tcl list,
for the specified file. Returns the full path name of the file, or
an empty string if the requested file could not be found.</p>
